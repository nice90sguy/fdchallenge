-> p1("Respond") ->
-> intent.respond(chat_last_msg, chat_last_t, chat_last_args) ->

You notice she's offline now, so you sit back and wait. You re-read what she typed, and think to yourself, "Maybe I should say hi or something."  Or maybe be a little more polite.  You type:
-> M_Y("Hello") ->
-> p1("Wait for her to come online") ->
-> ffa(second, 63) ->
You wait for less than a minute, and then...
~ set_bella_online(true)
-> M_B("Hi") ->
The shock of reading her instant reply make you suddenly find yourself unable to respond for a minute.
-> cont ->
-> M_B("Well? lol") ->
-> M_Y("sry i couldnt think of what to say lol") ->

You're beginning to wake up to the weird impulsiveness, not to say insanity of what you've done.   Why did you so quickly decide to do this?  And why do you have such a strong impluse to jump to do what she tells you, almost as though her commands are bypassing your brain?
Does she even remember who you are?
-> cont ->
~decstat(confidence)
-> M_Y("I dont know if you remember me, I'm the guy whose oysters you ate! It was my last night in New York") ->
-> M_B("ofc I remember") ->

She doesn't continue after that, and you're stumped for what to say.  She's not very talkative!
-> cont ->
-> ffa(second, 20) ->
You wonder if she'd be annoyed if you just quit the chat and logged off.
{hint()} (She would be very annoyed!)

Maybe you should ask what you're actually getting from her for your ${FAN_CLUB_SIGNON_FEE}.  But somehow you don't feel like offending her.
You notice that every time you've been sending her chat messages, there's been a little number next to your message:

-> M_YP("There's a number next to my chat messages") ->

-> M_B("thats your credits.") ->

-> M_Y("It's going down by {print_number(cost_per_message)} all the time?") ->

She doesn't respond for a minute, but then types:

-> M_B("type something now") ->

~ cost_per_message = 10
You type
-> M_Y("hello, world") ->
-> cont ->
You type it again, to double-check:
-> M_Y("hello, world") ->
-> cont ->
-> M_B("lol keep talking, {YOUR_NAME}") ->
-> cont ->
You figure out that every time you send a message, the site charges you. And that {BELLA_NAME} is seemingly able to change the price!
-> M_B("type hello world again, you nerd  {YOUR_NAME} lol") ->
You ignore her, but she types it again!
-> intent.respond("hello world", now(), BELLA+cmd_repeat_after_me) ->
{obeyed_cmd:-> intent.respond("Good boy. Again.", now(), BELLA+cmd_again) -> }
-> M_B("lol dont worry im setting the price back to only one credit for a message.  You need your credits for more than chatting {devil_happy()}") ->
~ cost_per_message = 1
-> ffa(minute, 1) ->
-> cont ->
You don't know why, but you're kind of turned on by this conversation.
~ set_bella_online(false)
You wait around to see if she's going to say anything else, but it doesn't look like it.
You type
-> M_Y("ty lol") ->
, and notice that it only cost you one credit, as she promised.
You sit back, wondering even more than ever who she is, and leave the chat, to explore the rest of her site.
