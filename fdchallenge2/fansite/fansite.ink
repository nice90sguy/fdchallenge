{bella()} Welcome to My Fan Page! I'm sure you'll be here a lot!

The first thing you need to do is to add some credits, it looks like you don't have any yet!  You won't be able to do much here unless you have plenty of them!
I suggest you purchase as many credits as you can, because the more you buy, the cheaper they are!
That's your first lesson in money management, and guess what, I gave it to you for free! Ain't I  generous? 

I'm usually online here between {ampm_hm(bella_online_start_hour, 0)} and  {ampm_hm(bella_online_end_hour, 0)}.

But even when I'm not here, there's plenty to do!

You can browse my amazing pics and videos and other merch in My shop.  Or if you're feeling weak, you can always tribute Me.  That will make Me <i>really</i> happy; and, therefore, of course, it will make you happy too. Win win!!

When I'm online, you can chat with Me.  But make sure you always greet Me first.  And you know what I mean by "greet".  If you don't, you soon will ðŸ¤£

If I like you, you can even book a private, one on one video session with Me! I charge by the minute, so make sure your credits are topped up before you do that, or I might ban you from this site indefinitely!  Just remember, Time is Money.  My time, your money.

Welcome, and congratulations for being one of My SUPER FANS!!
