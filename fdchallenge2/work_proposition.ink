You don't know what she means, but you suddenly feel dread.  She's definitely serious about something.  You respond quickly:
{M_wa_S(YOU)}Ok.

{M_wa_S(BELLA)} You're a tech guy arent you
You're not sure where she's going with this:
-> cont ->
{M_wa_S(YOU)}Yes.
{M_wa_S(BELLA)} i have a great job for you
You wait for her to go on. The app shows that she's busy typing...
-> cont ->
...and typing...

Eventually you get a long message from her:
{M_wa_S(BELLA)} 
I have some videos on my site that need their tags checked, there are a lot of them.  Some of them will also need to be converted to .mp4 files.  i will pay you for the work of course,  a fair rate, dont worry.  you need to start today. i will send you the links to the files in a minute and then you can start immediately.  i suggest you empty your balls before you start work from now on, you will not be very productive otherwise lol
{M_wa_S(BELLA)} the work won't take long, if you do it non stop. I'll pay you ${payment_for_correct_video_tag} per video if you tag them correctly. 
{M_wa_S(BELLA)} oh in case you were wondering, no you dont have a choice and yes, im serious about all this.  
{M_wa_S(BELLA)} any questions?


{M_wa_S(YOU)}no

{M_wa_S(BELLA)}good. start now
