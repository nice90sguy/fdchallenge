{grind == 1:
{hint()} This mini-game is the "Daily Grind".  As the name suggests, it's a repetitve, real-time simulation of the next week of your life, day by day, hour by hour, minute by f***ing minute...<br><>
    Your choice of activity will alter your stats, and could end up opening, or possibly closing doors to possible futures!<br><>
    Try to stick to a healthy routine, socialize a little too. Don't get too distracted, or spend too much time contempating your navel. Unless you have some kind of self-destructive urge, that is... üòÅ<br><>
    Lastly, be patient, good (and bad) things happen to those who wait -- and I promise you, in seven days' time, you'll escape this endless, tedious, <b>Daily Grind...
