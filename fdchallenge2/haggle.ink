She has a "reserve" price which she never tells you. If you bid more than the reserve price, you'll get what she's offering and of course have to pay for it.<br>If you fail to bid above her reserve price, you get nothing -- but you'll still have to pay her! <br>If you don't have enough in your account she'll be pissed off, and negative consequences could ensue for you.  The outcome of a Haggle will never alter your major path through the story however.
